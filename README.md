# Speaking Clock Kata

The goal of this code kata is to design a Conversational Clock - 
a cluster of objects, capable of telling the current system time in a conversational format.


Here are several examples of what the Conversational Clock should tell, depending on the time of the day:

# Time	and Expected Output
- 01:00 and 13:00 it's one o'clock
- 08:07	it's seven past eight
- 12:00	it's noon
- 24:00	it's midnight
- 02:30	it's half past three
- 14:50	it's ten to three
- 14:45	it's a quarter to three
- 13:58	it's almost two o'clock
- 14:01	it's just after two o'clock
